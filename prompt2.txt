Below are the guidelines for creating two DataFrames (header_df and inline_df) based on the extracted invoice data.
Please use these instructions as a prompt when writing your code, and ensure that you comply with all requirements.

# Task 3

# Instructions
	•	Create header_df using the extracted header information.
	•	Columns: Invoice Number, Invoice Date, Sender Name, Invoice Amount, Currency Code
	•	Create inline_df using the extracted inline information.
	•	Columns: Product, Unit Quantity, Unit, Unit Price, HS Code, Total Amount

# Important Notes
1.	Invoice Amount, Unit Price, Total Amount
	•	Although these are numeric values, treat them as strings in the DataFrame.
	•	Do not alter the extracted formatting (including commas and decimals).
2.	HS Code
	•	Treat it as text.
	•	Must strictly follow the xxxx.xx format with exactly 6 digits.
	•	Example: Correct: 0123.45; Incorrect: 123.45
3.	Invoice Date
	•	Treat it as a string.
	•	Must follow YYYY-MM-DD format.
	•	Example: 2012-01-01
4.	NaN Values
	•	For any NaN value, replace it with -.

# Final Output
    •	Enter all values as strings.
	•	Apply all the rules mentioned above.
	•	Please you must only output python code without annotation to avoid error. Because code will be used directly using exec() fuction.
