# Task 1 (Header Elements)

## Required Elements (5 total)
1.	Invoice Number
	•	Generally located at the top part of the document, often on the right side.
	•	May appear as “Invoice No.”, “Invoice Number”, or “No. of Invoice”.
2.	Invoice Date

	•	For example:
	•	4,Aug,2017 → 2017-08-04
	•	4-30-2006 → 2006-04-30
	•	Be careful not to confuse it with “Date of Departure” or “L/C Date”.
	•	If only “Date of Departure” or “L/C Date” exists without “Invoice Date” or “Date of Issue”, you must follow output NaN, please.
	•	If not found, output NaN.
3.	Sender Name
	•	Located at the top (left or right side).
	•	May appear as “Shipper”, “Seller”, “Exporter” and so on.

	•	Retain any decimals and format as 1,234.56.
5.	Currency Code
	•	If the word “Currency” is not mentioned, determine the currency by the symbol before the amount:
	•	$ → USD
	•	€ → EUR
